To run experiments with pretrained model:
Clone repo for transformation
git clone https://github.com/majerfil/transformation.git

roslaunch radar radar.launch

In seperate window run rosbag for training 
rosbag play ~/datasets/radar/second/processed/velo_res/velo_res_no_smoke.bag 
after finishing run rosbag with smoke;
rosbag play ~/datasets/radar/fourth/processed/move_smoke_2.bag 

cd ~/.ros/log/latest/
mv evaluator-3-stdout.log ~/datasets/radar/evaluation/log/ev_fourth_move_smoke_2.log

running the evaluation go to repo and run:
./compute ../log/ev_fourth_move_smoke_2.log a

For online learning skip running first rosbag and run desired rosbag to train.
