Branch for Deep Learning 

To use online learning for radar-based human model (radar_detector_ol.cpp), make sure:

1. You have libsvm (`sudo apt-get install libsvm-dev libsvm-tools`)
2. You have `grid.py` (must be executable `chmod +x`) in `.ros`

Please view the Wiki page, for how to recreate experiments.
This includes links to the rosbags.
